# YADLA

YADLA exists right now as two parts.  The first is an Android app to view Nightscout data on an Android phone.  AGP and daily views are available.

There is also an uploader to insert Dexcom G4 (G5 not yet supported) and Tandem t:slim (and probably other Tandem pump) data into a Nightscout instance.

To use, download the release alrightypump-commandline.tar.gz or alrightypump-commandline.zip archive and run `alrighty-pump-commandline/bin/alrightypump-commandline.{sh, bat} http://secret-password@nightscout.example.com:port/`
